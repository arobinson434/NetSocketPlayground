# Network Socket Playground

I have been working my way through
[Beej's Guide to Network Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_USLetter.pdf)
and wanted to use this repo as a proving ground for a few simple networking
socket examples. These examples will lean heavily on his code
snippets, so major props to the Beej!

The real purpose of me writing all of this out, is to track things I learn
along the way, which may mean that the write-ups for some of these examples
will stray from the original point of the program. Sorry if it comes off as a 
little A.D.D. :p
