# Simple Client
Yup, its a simple client. This code is pretty straight forward. I really just
wanted code that showed how `connect` would choose a random port to bind to
locally and would establish the connection with the peer. This client works
with any of the simple server variants in this repo. It simply connects, gets a
message, prints some debug, and closes the connection.
